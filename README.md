# CFG Final Project - Fullstack 1 Group 3

This project was created by Eleri, Maddy, Meg, Niki and Kudzai 

## HELPFUL TIPS

The 'client' folder stores the frontend React code. The 'server' folder contains the backend express code. The 'database' folder contains the database SQL code. The 'resources' folder contains any miscellaneous code. 

To start the development server on your local machine
1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the server folder (e.g. `cd server`). Once you are in the server folder, type in the command `nodemon index.js`. The backend server is now running. 
2. Now open a new terminal and navigate to the client folder (e.g. `cd client`). Once you are in the client folder, type in the command `npm start`. This should open up a new window in your browser, and show the correctly running and linked up development server!

When you want to stop the development server from running (and you should do so when you stop working on it, otherwise your computer will keep running it in the background) type Ctrl + C into each of the two terminals you opened to stop both the frontend and backend -when it says "Terminate batch job (Y/N)?" you can type Y and press enter.

**Currently, the key files to be edited within the client folder are App.js, App.css and any files within the component folder. Within the server folder the key file to be edited is index.js**
