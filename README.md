This project was created by Eleri, Maddy, Meg, Niki and Kudzai 

## To note

The 'client' folder stores the frontend React code. The 'server' folder contains the backend Flask code. The 'database' folder contains the database SQL code. The 'resources' folder contains any miscellaneous code. 

**Currently, the key files to be edited are server.py, App.js, App.css**

### Eventually this ReadMe will demonstrate how our project functions.
