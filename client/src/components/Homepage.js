                      <p>Welcome to "It's Not You, It's Me!". Created by a team of 
                        five passionate women from the Code First Girls degree program, 
                        INYIM redefines digital game nights by replacing the frustration 
                        of overly competitive chance-based games. It instead introduces a 
                        humorous and collaborative game that fosters relationship-building 
                        discussions, showcasing your understanding of your loved ones.</p>
                      <br />
                      <p>Discover the beauty of digital gamesâ€” a medium that effortlessly 
                        bridges any distance. Play with your roommate or connect with your 
                        cousin on the other side of the world! In a world where human connection 
                        is hugely important, we hope INYIM helps to bring you closer to those you love.</p>

                    <p>"It's Not You, It's Me" is an online multiplayer game that links 
                      two players for interactive fun. The game asks the players questions 
                      about themselves- the players must then pick who between them they believe 
                      to be the answer to the question. For example you may have to decide- "Who 
                      is the better driver?" or "Who is more likely to be late for work?". Each 
                      player selects their answer, and a point is earnt every time the players 
                      have matching responses. After 10 questions, the final score will appear!</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Think you know your family? Are you and your bestie on the same wavelength 
                      and can reach 10/10? Time to find out... </p>
