// React is made up of lots of 'components'.
// These components can be specific functions to then be called on in the code
// Or in this case, this component 'Homepage' is the page that displays when the user is at the root URL. 
// A component/page will be structured like this: 

// import statements go at the top here

// function Homepage() {

//     any functions to be used within the page are defined here

// return (

//     The actual code to be displayed goes here- written like HTMLAllCollection

// )
// };

// export default Homepage;
