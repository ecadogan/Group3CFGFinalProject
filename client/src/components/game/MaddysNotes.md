The component RoomHome.js is currently acting as the homepage for the 'play' button. this will eventually need to move to our actual homepage

Still to do:

Work out how to show the final score on the result page
Work out whether/how usernames can be shown on the cards rather than just 'Player 1' and 'Player 2'
Add useful comments to the code


Everyone to install:

npm install dotenv
npm install socket.io
npm install shortid
npm install socket.io-client
